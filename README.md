# Stripe Integration using Next.JS

Practical 5 - This practical involved me adding stripe checkout/purchase functionality for singular products stored in a firebase realtime database.

## Description

I had to fetch the json data from my firebase rtd and display the data in individual product cards, I then had to add the functionality that redirects the user to a stripe powered purchase page when the user clicks the buy button on a product. I used Next.JS for this project along with scss styling.

### Dependencies

* react
* react-dom
* sass

### Dev Dependencies
* @stripe/stripe-js
* eslint
* eslint-config-next
* stripe

### Installing

* In order to make this function with your database you will have to add in your own firebase configuration keys to the .env.local file.


### Executing program
* Install dependencies using "npm i"
* Run using script "npm run dev"
